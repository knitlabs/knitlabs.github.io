        We are a bunch of storytellers who also happen to be data enthusiast. We
        are fascinated by the little questions. Questions such as why we eat the
        food we eat? Or why some countries do better than others in some
        regards?

        We use data science to tell stories and theories on why things are the
        way they are. Our passions vary from Mathematics and Computer Science to
        History and Behavioral Psychology. We believe data science is a powerful
        tool that aids us in putting together this enormous jigsaw puzzle called
        human history. We believe it is important to understand our past to
        build a meaningful future.
